# Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Transactions Not Showing After Login
**Problem**: After logging in, transactions from Google Sheets were not visible.
**Root Cause**: 
- User filtering was still active in transaction display
- CORS issues with Google Apps Script requests
- Vault calculation was incorrect due to user filtering

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Removed User Filtering**: Modified AppContext to show all transactions regardless of current user
2. **Fixed CORS Issues**: Removed `no-cors` mode from fetch requests to allow reading responses
3. **Fixed Vault Calculation**: Updated vault to allow negative values and recalculate from all transactions
4. **Added Manual Sync**: Added sync button in header for manual Google Sheets synchronization

### 2. Vault Not Displaying Correctly
**Problem**: Vault was not showing correct values or was empty.
**Root Cause**: 
- Vault migration logic only allowed non-negative values
- Vault was calculated only from user-specific transactions instead of all transactions

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Allow Negative Vault Values**: Removed constraint preventing negative vault counts
2. **Recalculate from All Transactions**: Added logic to recalculate vault based on all transactions
3. **Proper Vault Updates**: Fixed vault updates to use allTransactions instead of filtered transactions

## Testing Checklist

After making these changes, verify:

1. ‚úÖ **Login and See All Data**: Log in with any user and verify all historical transactions are visible
2. ‚úÖ **Vault Shows Correct Values**: Check vault page shows proper denomination counts (including negatives)
3. ‚úÖ **New Transactions Attributed Correctly**: Create new transactions and verify they're attributed to current user
4. ‚úÖ **Manual Sync Works**: Use the "Sync" button in header to manually load data from Google Sheets
5. ‚úÖ **Cross-User Visibility**: Login with different users and confirm all see the same transaction data

## Debug Features

### Console Logging
Enhanced console logging with emojis for easy debugging:
- üîÑ Sync operations
- üì° Connection tests
- üì• Data loading
- üßÆ Vault calculations
- ‚úÖ Success operations
- ‚ùå Error operations

### Manual Sync Button
Located in the header next to user name - allows manual synchronization with Google Sheets.

## Important Notes

1. **Authentication Still Required**: Users must still log in to access the application
2. **New Transaction Attribution**: New transactions are still recorded with the creating user's information
3. **Data Visibility**: All users can now see all transaction data regardless of who created it
4. **Vault Calculations**: Vault now reflects the sum of ALL cash transactions, not just user-specific ones

## If Issues Persist

1. **Clear Browser Data**: Clear localStorage and reload the application
2. **Check Console**: Look for error messages in browser developer console
3. **Verify Google Apps Script**: Ensure the Google Apps Script is deployed and accessible
4. **Test Manual Sync**: Use the sync button to force data loading from Google Sheets
